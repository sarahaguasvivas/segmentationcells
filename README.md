# Cell segmentation using MATLAB

This program has the purpose to ultimately segment an image in order
to find the relative intensity of the signal in Channel 1 based on the
cell walls form Channel 2.
----------Requirements:-----------
-Latest version of MATLAB (R2017b)
-Computer with GPU capabilities (also GPU driver up to date (update CUDA))
For reference it was developed in 
a Mac OS Sierra with CUDA and these specs from gpuDevice
